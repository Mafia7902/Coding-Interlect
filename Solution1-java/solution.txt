Each line consists of the instructions for a single spaceship. In this case there are 10 spaceships. spaceship 1 visited Crate A then base a, spaceship 2 visited Crate B then base b, spaceship 3 visited Crate C then base c, spaceship 4 visited Crate D then base d, spaceship 5 visited Crate E then base e, spaceship 6 visited Crate F then base f, spaceship 7 visited Crate G then base g, spaceship 8 visited Crate H then base h, spaceship 9 visited Crate I then base i, spaceship 10 visited Crate J then base j,  spaceship 10 visited Crate K then base k, spaceship 10 visited Crate L then base l, spaceship 10 visited Crate M then base m, spaceship 10 visited Crate N then base n, spaceship 10 visited Crate O then base o, spaceship 10 visited Crate P then base p, spaceship 10 visited Crate Q then base q, spaceship 10 visited Crate R then base r, spaceship 10 visited Crate S then base s, spaceship 10 visited Crate T then base t, spaceship 10 visited Crate U then base u, spaceship 10 visited Crate V then base v, spaceship 10 visited Crate W then base w, spaceship 10 visited Crate X then base x, spaceship 10 visited Crate Y then base y, spaceship 10 visited Crate Z then base z. The total Manhattan distance travelled is 4256.
The final score is 4256.
